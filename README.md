# MindSet - find your positive thought :relaxed:

MindSet is a mobile-responsive web app to help the user find and use positive affirmations. The user selects the category of affirmation they want to see, and a random affirmation in that category is generated. The app also includes instructions and background on using positive affirmations.

MindSet was built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and Express.
